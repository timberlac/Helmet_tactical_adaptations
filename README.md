# Helmet tactical adaptations
A tactical helmet is the opportunity to create new services in safety and security.

The first goal of this project is to allows making pictures or short movies.
Sometimes, indeed, we are disapointed because we don't have the device to do that.
I thing here, for example, to a tracted fly on a glide or others strong human experimentations.

So, with only one or two button, we can do this. And a tactical helmet owns the mecanical supports 
that we will need.

On this project, two tiny electonics will be engaged (200mA): 
  - a Raspberry PI0W with a camera module
  - an ESP32 Cam, powerless

All of them are could be connected with a WiFi connection. 

However the only tactical helmet is not enough and I have to build mecanical interfaces
for supports : frontal adaptator NVG for the camera, lateral interface for the command and 
a behind interface for supply interface guaranteeing the safety in all circumstances.
