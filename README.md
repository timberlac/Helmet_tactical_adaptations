# Helmet tactical adaptations
A tactical helmet is the opportunity to create new embedded services in safety and security.

## Goals are a lot but one to start
The first goal of this project is to allows making pictures or short movies.
Sometimes, indeed, we are disapointed because we don't have the device to do that.
I thing here, for example, to a tracted fly on a glide or others strong human experimentations
in the sky or in stressed conditions.

## Providing an intuitive user interface
So, with only one or two button, we can do this. And a tactical helmet owns the mecanical supports 
that we will need.

## Two ways in electronic
On this project, two tiny electonics will be engaged (200mA):

1. a Raspberry PI0W with a camera module
2. an ESP32 Cam, powerless than other

All of them are could be connected with a WiFi connection. 

## 3D printings
However the only tactical helmet is not enough and I have to build mecanical interfaces
for supports : **frontal adaptator NVG** for the camera, **lateral interface** for the command and 
a **behind interface** for supply interface guaranteeing the safety in all circumstances.
